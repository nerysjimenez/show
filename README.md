    This is a Javascript program using AJAX and PHP that shows data from the PRESIDENTS table.
    show.html allows users to enter a PRESIDENT_ID into a text field.
    show.php creates a server response which will fill in the values of name, party, 
    and year elected on that page if the PRESIDENT_ID exists.
